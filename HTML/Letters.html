            No matter how detailed and attentive you are,
            you're going to make a mistake at work. It's not a
            reflection of you or your work ethic; it's an
            inevitable reality. In other instances,you'll want to
            say you're sorry for a coworker's loss.<br>
            <br>
            Whether it's mean cupla or a letter of condolence,
            a well-written letter informs the read of your
            genuine remorse. In some instances, a timely
            apology letter can prevent a mistake from 
            snowballing into a carrer-ruining disaster; in 
            others, your words can offer comfort to a 
            colleague.<br>
